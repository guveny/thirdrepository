# Vagrant Introduction

**Installing and configuring a Web Development environment on a new computer is a lot of work, even for experienced web developers.**

To make things simple for you and also give you real and powerful tools (rather than dumbed down installation versions, that fall apart as soon as you branch out on your own) we're going to use a very popular and powerful development environment called [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/).

Vagrant will allow us to create a small virtual computer running inside our current computer. Inside this virtual computer we'll be running all of our web development tools.

## Using Vagrant

Starting vagrant up and using all the web development tools inside of it is a slightly different for Apple Macintosh or Windows user.

## Choose your operating system
